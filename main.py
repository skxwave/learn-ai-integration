"""
AI Integration Examples - Main Application Entry Point (DEPRECATED)

Note: This file is deprecated as examples are now organized in separate folders.
Each example can be run independently from its respective directory.

To run individual examples, navigate to the example folder and run the Python file directly.
For example: python examples/01-fastapi-basics/day_one.py
"""
# from fastapi import FastAPI
# from examples... import router
